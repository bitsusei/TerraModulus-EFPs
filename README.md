## Execution Framework Proposals (EFPs)

> **EFPs** \[...] provide standards, methods, and structured execution plans.
> This includes but not limited to strategies, projects, guidelines and standards.
>
> EFPs shall either: outline how a project, procedure or initiative will be executed,
> managed, and monitored to achieve its objectives;
> or explain or define a certain mechanism which would be applied onto the Architecture.

**Execution Framework Proposals**, or EFPs, are the structured documents that outlline how
a project, procedure or initiative will be executed, managed, and monitored to achive its
objectives; or explain or define a certain mechanism which would be applied into the community.

> An EFP may involve the Architecture, a mechanism, a plan or a scheme. It may not be highly
> executive, but may involve certain objectives, deliverables, or boundaries of the Project.
> There may not be time constrains, but the milestones and objectives may be decided
> in the roadmap. Moreover, it would be intended to standardize and guide the Project or
> a process. Occasionally, certain EFPs may solicit feedback from the Community depending
> on the context, so EFPs may be updated and revised upon feedbacks or progressions.
> However, the topics or the themes of the EFPs should not be changed, or else a new EFP
> should be issued for the new content and updates. Certainly, detailed descriptions should
> always be included to ensure that the goals and methods are generally understood,
> except for the progressional development of the thoughts to be included in the related ERDs.
